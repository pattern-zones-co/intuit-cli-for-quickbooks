# Changelog

All notable changes to the Intuit QuickBooks CLI are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The token encryption key is now kept in a `0600` key file per profile, `~/.config/intuit-cli/<profile>.key`, instead of the OS keychain. On headless Linux the keychain silently fell back to the kernel keyring, which is wiped on reboot, so every reboot logged you out. Keys stored in the keychain by older versions aren't migrated: run `auth login` again after upgrading. The `@napi-rs/keyring` dependency is removed.

### Fixed

- A missing key file, or one that can't decrypt the token file, is now reported as an error naming both files. Previously the CLI generated a new key and reported "Not authenticated". `auth logout` still clears a profile whose token file can't be decrypted.
- Token files are written atomically (temp file, fsync, rename), so a crash mid-write can't leave a truncated token file.
- Token refresh no longer fails with "The Refresh token is invalid, please Authorize again." one hour after `auth login`. The CLI loaded only `refresh_token` into intuit-oauth, whose local expiry check then always failed before any request reached Intuit, so both automatic refresh and `auth refresh` broke once the access token expired. The refresh token's expiry is now stored at login and on each refresh (`refresh_expires_at`) and passed to intuit-oauth; tokens saved by older versions fall back to Intuit's 8726400-second lifetime.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Repository renamed to `intuit/intuit-cli-for-quickbooks`. `package.json` URLs and README install instructions updated to the new canonical URL (GitHub redirects the old URL transparently).

### Security

- Bumped transitive dependencies via `npm audit fix`: `axios` to 1.17.0 and `follow-redirects` to 1.16.0, clearing one high and one moderate severity advisory.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Optional Premium API scope configuration via `.env`: set `INTUIT_SANDBOX_PREMIUM_SCOPES` or `INTUIT_PROD_PREMIUM_SCOPES` to a space- or comma-separated list of raw OAuth scope strings (e.g. `project-management.project`). Apps without Premium approval should leave it empty.
- `auth status` now displays the requested OAuth scopes alongside other token state, separating standard from Premium scopes.
- `--debug` output now includes the full response body (JSON pretty-printed, capped at 8KB) for both REST and GraphQL calls, making it easier to diagnose API failures.
- `custom-fields update` command — rename, activate/deactivate, or add forms to existing field definitions.

### Changed

- `auth login` now requests only standard scopes (`com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting` and `openid`) by default. Premium scopes are opt-in via `INTUIT_<env>_PREMIUM_SCOPES`. Previously all Premium scopes were requested unconditionally, which caused OAuth failures for apps without Premium API approval.
- `custom-fields create` rewritten to send the full GraphQL input the QBO server requires (`subAssociations`, `validationOptions`, `allowedOperations`). The previous schema was incomplete and every create failed.
- `--scope` flag on `custom-fields create` renamed to `--category` (matches the QBO UI category picker: customer, vendor, project, transaction).
- New `--forms` flag on `custom-fields create` controls which form types the field appears on (invoice, estimate, bill, expense, etc.). Comma-separated or repeatable.
- `projects create` mutation no longer sends `account.id` — the Premium GraphQL server infers the realm from the OAuth bearer token.
- `projects create` and `projects update` validate `--status` upfront against the actual enum values (`OPEN`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETE`). The help text previously documented `COMPLETED`, which the server rejects.
- `items create` validates account references upfront with actionable error messages. Service and NonInventory items require `--expense-account-ref`; Service also requires `--income-account-ref`. Group items are rejected (not creatable via API). Category items reject account flags.
- `dimensions attach` filters out non-item lines (SubTotal, group summaries) that can't hold dimensions. The dry-run previously displayed them as `Line undefined`.
- GraphQL error responses with HTTP 200 status are now surfaced as errors. Previously the CLI silently returned partial data when the response body contained an `errors` field.
- `package.json` repository, homepage, and bugs URLs corrected to `github.com/intuit/intuit-cli`.

### Fixed

- README install instructions and links updated to the correct repository URL.
